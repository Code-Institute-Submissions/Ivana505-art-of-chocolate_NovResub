# Marketing Strategy

7 P's Marketing Strategy was used throughout the whole process of this project : 

- Product - Chocolate used is made from the finest cocoa solids and cocoa butter and as such will be marked as a "pure ingredients and high quality product".
- Promotion - Lot of promotions will be organised through Newsletters, Social Media, online events and other.
- Price - Price of all products is the same but the Company will make new strategies and planning for Newsletter and Social Media Campaigns. There will always be discounts there so we can engage more people to buy the product.
- Place - As a startup Company we will wait for few months before deciding on the best place to show off our product.
- People - People in our team will grow how the team grows, making sure customers are happy and that they are starting to promote the product free by "word of mouth".
- Process - All processes and materials used are sustainable and this will be presented to the customer.
- Physical Evidence - Company owns a factory where all chocolates are produced but main point of sale will be our Website.

Part of a Business Strategy is also a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) mockup page, made with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/):
